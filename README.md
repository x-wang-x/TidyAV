6. Then just wait till it done detect movie 
7. After that, you can chose just rename it or u want to move it to master folder ( your setting )
8. You can double check your final list before click apply ( do it, cause when you already applied you cannot revert it)

Known bugs : <br>
  1. Moving files in different root dir (ex : C:\ to D:\ ) sometimes make application not responding, but dont worry the operation still running in the background. I recomend you to let it be when u moving lot of files, just wait till it over ( u can check from progress bar). Dont try to move or drag the application, it might make the software not responding like i sad before. <br>
In other way, if you trying organize file in the same root dir, it happen instanly tho.It might done in seconds.<br>
<br>
This is the early version, definitely not perfect. <br>
